# Next.js 15 App Router Dynamic Route Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic routes and data fetching.  The application works correctly on the initial page load, but subsequent navigation to different dynamic routes results in unexpected behavior, typically failing to fetch data properly or rendering an error.

## Bug Description
The application uses a dynamic route (`/users/[id]`) to fetch and display user data. While the initial load works fine, navigating between different user profiles using client-side navigation causes the data fetching to fail, leading to an incomplete or erroneous display.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the initial load of `/users/1`.  It should load correctly.
5. Try navigating to `/users/2`. The problem should manifest here (either incorrect data, error, or blank screen).

## Potential Causes
Several factors might be at play, including:
* Incorrect data fetching setup with the `use` or `fetch` function in the App Router.
* Improper use of React's useState hook or context APIs for managing fetched data.
* Problems with client-side routing and data caching.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring data is fetched properly in response to client-side navigation, this often includes using a proper suspense mechanism. This requires adjustments to how data fetching is performed within the dynamic route component and leveraging React's features for handling asynchronous operations effectively.
